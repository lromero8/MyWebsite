          <p class="blog-paragraph">Forest</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">I think this is my favorite app because it’s the one I use the more. It helps me to stay focus for longer periods of time. You have to set how much time you want to stay focus and the app disables all apps and push notifications on your phone, leaving you only with a tree of your choice, if you leave the app you will kill your tree. The nice thing about Forest is that you can see your virtual trees in a forest each day or week, and you can share it with your friends.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">The pro version enables you to buy different trees, plant trees with your friends at the same time, and the best thing is that you can choose to spend your coins on real trees in Africa so your focus time will benefit the environment.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Headspace</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Headspace is a meditation app with a gorgeous interface. Apart from a much-needed service (teaching people how to incorporate meditation and mindfulness into their self-care routine) it’s just a fun app to play with. I mostly use to go to sleep and just listen to nature sounds, but if you want to get into meditation, I think it’s one the best in the market. Plus, you might find yourself scrolling through the app just to see all the lovely illustrations.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Duolingo</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">I have put this app in this list because I believe learning can help you stay mentally healthy, especially if the learning it’s fun and at your own pace. Right now, I am learning German because my girlfriend is from there and also, I feel people does not give the language a chance for the way it sounds, it scares people out, but I feel that when you give a chance you would realize that it is fun the way it changes its structure all the time.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Strava</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">This app is the best for running and biking. It is super responsive and fast, you almost never loose connection with your GPS, and the accuracy is on point. I have used this app for almost three years now, I even ran a marathon with it, and I can say is very reliable and minimal. You can start recording your work-out right away without any interruption or advertisements. The best thing is that is compatible with almost all sport watches and smartwatches out there, so you can simply wear your watch and when you are done it will synchronize with your phone.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Keep Notes</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">This is THE note app for me. Keep quickly capture what’s on your mind and get a reminder later at the right place or time. Speak a voice memo on the go and have it automatically transcribed. Grab a photo of a poster, receipt or document and easily organize or find it later in search. For me is one of the best notes apps I’ve come across. It’s sleek and sophisticated with a stunning yet simple interface. You can use it for a range of writing needs but for me it works best for actual note taking.</p>
