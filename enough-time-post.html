          <p class="blog-paragraph">We are living in a hectic world in which we sometimes feel we are simply being pushed through every experience of our daily life, without feeling present at every moment of the day. Sometimes it feels that we are just trying to keep up with whatever it’s going on in the world, without even being able to grasp what we are doing. We try to fill in the gaps: buying the latest thing from whatever we think we need, connections with more people (or virtual connections for that matter), filling time with what we think is necessary. So, why are not we doing enough?</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">We often fall into the trap of always working harder, keep going for longer or we would be a failure and we would fall behind the trend. We want the edge; we want to get ahead. And this concept applies even to leisure. We want to make the most of our “free time”; accomplish things that we believe will be beneficial to us in the long run: watching the latest series to have new conversation starters with our friends, watching the latest game of the Raptors, dining at the new restaurant around the corner. It almost feels like we should learn to take time off from our free time.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Productivity is something we spend so much time trying to focus on, build on and achieve, but to what end, why are we trying to be productive in the first place? Perhaps we are afraid of spending time alone. Sometimes we are scared by having so much time on our hands and not knowing what to do with it. Since when is having a nice dinner by ourselves is something to laugh about? Afraid to take a moment to think and say “stop”, and enjoy the silence for a while. Taking time to reflect and work in our peace of mind is something we neglect and do not even consider. The greatest growth comes through the recovery of the effort previously made, so we need our own time.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">Perhaps society plays the most important role in the way we spend our time. Perfectionism is the main incentive; every time we scroll through Instagram, we see the newest iPhone, or when we realized someone knows a JavaScript framework you have not even heard of, we have a preconceived notion that we have to have/know it all, that our lives need to be perfect. Achieving what we think we need takes up a lot of space in our minds, so it makes us spend a lot of time doing what we can to achieve it. Although wanting these things is not a bad thing but when our sole purpose depends on it, we are predestined to never be satisfied and consequently not be productive.</p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">On the whole, have we even asked ourselves what is the big rush. Have we considered that it is just not enough time to do it all anyway? The more we think about productivity the more we need to take care of ourselves by taking care of our time. Taking care for ourselves should be productive enough, we need to find tranquility by living with simplicity and modest pleasures, because being present in the moment and enjoying the process does not take that much.</p>

        5 apps to help you stay mentally clear

Forest
I think this is my favorite app because it’s the one I use the more. It helps me to stay focus for longer periods of time. You have to set how much time you want to stay focus and the app disables all apps and push notifications on your phone, leaving you only with a tree of your choice, if you leave the app you will kill your tree. The nice thing about Forest is that you can see your virtual trees in a forest each day or week, and you can share it with your friends.
The pro version enables you to buy different trees, plant trees with your friends at the same time, and the best thing is that you can choose to spend your coins on real trees in Africa so your focus time will benefit the environment.
Headspace
Headspace is a meditation app with a gorgeous interface. Apart from a much-needed service (teaching people how to incorporate meditation and mindfulness into their self-care routine) it’s just a fun app to play with. I mostly use to go to sleep and just listen to nature sounds, but if you want to get into meditation, I think it’s one the best in the market. Plus, you might find yourself scrolling through the app just to see all the lovely illustrations.
Duolingo
I have put this app in this list because I believe learning can help you stay mentally healthy, especially if the learning it’s fun and at your own pace. Right now, I am learning German because my girlfriend is from there and also, I feel people does not give the language a chance for the way it sounds, it scares people out, but I feel that when you give a chance you would realize that it is fun the way it changes its structure all the time.
Strava
This app is the best for running and biking. It is super responsive and fast, you almost never loose connection with your GPS, and the accuracy is on point. I have used this app for almost three years now, I even ran a marathon with it, and I can say is very reliable and minimal. You can start recording your work-out right away without any interruption or advertisements. The best thing is that is compatible with almost all sport watches and smartwatches out there, so you can simply wear your watch and when you are done it will synchronize with your phone.
Keep Notes
This is THE note app for me. Keep quickly capture what’s on your mind and get a reminder later at the right place or time. Speak a voice memo on the go and have it automatically transcribed. Grab a photo of a poster, receipt or document and easily organize or find it later in search. For me is one of the best notes apps I’ve come across. It’s sleek and sophisticated with a stunning yet simple interface. You can use it for a range of writing needs but for me it works best for actual note taking.
